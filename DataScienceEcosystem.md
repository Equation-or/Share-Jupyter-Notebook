Exercise 8: Create a code cell to multiply and add numbers
Run code in Jupyter notebook.
5+3

```




    8




```python
Modulus (returns the remainder of the division)
20 % 6
```




    2




```python
Exponentiation (raising to a power)
3 ** 4
```




    81




```python
10 + 5 * 2 - 8 / 4 
```




    18.0




```python
a = 15
b = 4
a * b + 10 
```




    70



a = 15
b = 4
a * b + 10 


```python
Exercise 9: Create a code cell to convert minutes to hours

#Function to convert minutes to hours
def convert_minutes_to_hours(minutes):
    hours = minutes / 60 # Convert minutes to hours
    return hours

# Define the number of minutes to convert
minutes = 120 # You can change this number to any value you want to convert

# Call the function and print the result
hours = convert_minutes_to_hours(minutes)
print(f"{minutes} minutes is equal to {hours} hours.") 
```

    120 minutes is equal to 2.0 hours.
